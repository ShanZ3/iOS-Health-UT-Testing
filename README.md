## The Purpose of Usability Test

There are several purposes to conduct this usability test:<br>
> 1) Test to see if the design of the interface is friendly to users <br>
> 2) Whether the app contains irrelevent informations <br>
> 3) Whether we need a help documentation to assist users in using this app <br>
> 4) Whether the user thinks the app match between system and the real world <br>

## Comment
* I should have used a more comprehensive user profile while when conducting this usablility test (i.e. import health provider so that the participant can experience with real data). Also, I should have let the participant try to do some data entry so that I can test for the app's error message function. In future, I will try to integrate facial, audio and screen recording together to ease the analysis process. Everything else went well.
